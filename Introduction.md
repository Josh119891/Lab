# Introduction

Hi, i am Josh Li. I got my bachelor degree about CS from University of Technoglogy ,Sydney.



I have about 3 years work experience on programming, and it basically focus on nodejs.

I beleve that i have enough ablitiy to handle the position.

First, I would talk  my last job experience. I worked as  a key developer on bridge five asia.

That product is a business asesst management web application, It is built in micro-servers and using mongoDB. . It is selling to other companies, like wework and capitalLand.



The product is able to forecast the cashflow report and capitalization rate with service models, like hotel,mixeduse.

In that working period, I introduce the swagger json fromat, design and create the customized data type on mongo. and finally the leader and I do the code review and create functions for whole team using.

And, personally, i have created a few tools to fill the the gap between developers and product managers.

Finally, I am familiar with scurm and agile methodology.  Becasuse generally I need to create and update the testing cases monthly for the accounting application and its accuracy,  I have tons of experiences about the testing.  



# Redux vs Vuex

I did not use redux before. I only have a few experience about Vuex.

But i believe that both of them are state management libraries.

- - Redux 使用的是不可变数据，而Vuex的数据是可变的。Redux每次都是用新的state替换旧的state，而Vuex是直接修改
  - Redux 在检测数据变化的时候，是通过 diff 的方式比较差异的，而Vuex其实和Vue的原理一样，是通过 getter/setter来比较的
